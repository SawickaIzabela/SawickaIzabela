 Hello, I’m Izabela Sawicka\
 I'm a technical writer with 8 years of experience in producing, maintatining and enhancing software projects documentation.\
 I have experience in writing:
 - Release Nootes
 - User Guides/Manuals
 - READMe files
 - Application Helps
 - Newsletters
 - and a lot more

I'm also passionate about User interface experience. I produce notifications, error messages and notes for software users that helps them use and troubleshoot the software products.

I’m currently preparing my Github profile and wanting to learn more on API documentation.
